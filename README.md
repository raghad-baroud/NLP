# Sentiment Analysis for Arabic Expo Visitor Reviews: A Comparative Study from Machine Learning to Transformers  

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of written Arabic reviews from Expo visitors to address challenges arising in mega-event management and the complex morphology of the Arabic language.

**Five Main Stages: **

1- Data Extraction from X-platform.

2- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.

3- Feature Extraction. 

4- Model Training. 

5- Model Evaluating. 


After training 19 different models, including classical machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models, an ensemble model combining transformer-based models as a feature extraction technique with RNN, LSTM, and GRU has demonstrated superior performance, reaching an 80% accuracy.
